\begin{tightemize}
\item I joined Scale to work at a hypergrowth startup on a new product called Scale Nucleus
\item We were a 4 man team, with me leading the go-to-market strategy, and writing code to ensure we found the first few customers
\item I would occasional write features, but the most of my day was spent performing integrations for customers, or mapping their problems to software.
\item I grew the product from 3 to 40 customers in the span of two months, using a lot of scruffy startup playbook rules, in search of product market fit.
